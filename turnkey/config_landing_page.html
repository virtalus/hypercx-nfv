  <h1>Please initialize this system...</h1>

  <p>Welcome to your new TurnKey appliance running in Virtalus HyperCX! You need to 
  initialize this system first before you can use it. To do that you'll need to log 
  into the root account via SSH or through VNC using the root password defined when 
  instantiating this VM (if any). After login in, this screen will be shown:

  <img src="/appliance-services.png" />

  This illustrates the available services in the appliance, but they are locked for
  the moment, until the appliance is initialized. Quit that dialog box and the 
  initialization process will start automatically:</p>

  <img src="/turnkey-init.png" />

  <p>Note: It is recommended to use an ssh connection, configuration setup might not 
  be displayed properly when using the VNC.</p>

  <p>After initialization try reloading this page. This message will disappear and 
  you'll be able to access all services on this system  normally.</p>

  <h2>Can I log in without SSH?</h2>

  <p>Yes, you can use the VNC console if a root password was defined when 
  instantiating the VM</p>

  <h2>How do I log in via SSH?</h2>

  <p>If you are connecting from Linux or MacOS, please open your terminal app and type
  the command:</p>

  <pre id="p1">ssh example</pre>

  <p>If you are connecting from Windows, you will need to install an SSH client, such 
  as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTY</a>.
  Then connect to: <strong id="p2">IP ADDRESS OR FQDN</strong></p>

  <p>Note: you will need your SSH keys configured in your user settings or in the template
  through the HyperCX web portal before instantiating this VM. If you set a root password, 
  you will not be able to use it via ssh for security reasons.</p>
