  <h1>Please initialize this system...</h1>

  <p>Welcome to your new TurnKey appliance running in Virtalus HyperCX! You need 
  to initialize this system first before you can use it. To do that you'll need 
  to log into the root account via SSH or through VNC using the root password defined when 
  instantiating this VM (if any). The initialization process will start automatically:</p>

  <img src="/turnkey-init-root.png" />

  <p>After initialization try reloading this page. This message will
  disappear and you'll be able to access all services on this system
  normally.</p>

  <h2>Can I log in without SSH?</h2>

  <p>Yes, you can use the VNC console only if a root password was defined 
  when instantiating the VM</p>

  <h2>How do I log in via SSH?</h2>

  <p>If you are connecting from Linux or MacOS, please open your terminal app
     and type the command:</p>

  <pre id="p1">ssh example</pre>

  <p>If you are connecting from Windows, you will need to install an SSH client, such as
     <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTY</a>.
     Then connect to: <strong id="p2">IP ADDRESS OR FQDN</strong></p>

  <p>Note: you will need to have set your SSH keys in your user settings or in the template
  through the HyperCX web portal before instantiating this VM. If you set a root password, 
  you will not be able to use it because it is disabled for security reasons.</p>
